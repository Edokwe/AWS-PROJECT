## Lab Objective:Implementing a Scalable, Highly Available Website in AWS

Objective:
To design, deploy, and validate a scalable, highly available, and secure web application using core AWS services. This lab aims to simulate real-world cloud architecture that ensures performance, reliability, and fault tolerance using AWS best practices.

---
Learning Outcomes:

- By the end of this lab, students/participants will be able to:

- Provision EC2 instances to serve web content.

- Configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for distributing incoming traffic.

- Set up Auto Scaling Groups to dynamically adjust capacity based on demand.

- Implement a highly available database using Amazon Dynamo DB (Multi-AZ)

- Configure Route 53 for domain name resolution and routing policies.

- Apply security best practices using Security Groups, IAM roles, and AWS WAF/Shield.

- Monitor system performance using Amazon CloudWatch and configure alerting.

- Test fault tolerance by simulating instance or AZ failures.
